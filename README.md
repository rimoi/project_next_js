# Test Frontend junior

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Goals

The objective of this test is to integrate the proposed design into a page.

The idea is to demonstrate that you know how to use and/or learn how to use React.

- [ ] determine a component breakdown
- [ ] Make a design integration
- [ ] Split his development into commits
- [ ] Use data from the endpoint [http://localhost:3000/api/translations](http://localhost:3000/api/translations)

As a result, we would like a git repository (gitlab/github/bitbucket/etc).

## Getting Started

First, you need to clone this repository.
Then you have to `cd` into it and `yarn|npm install`;

Now you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
